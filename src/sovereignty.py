TRIBAL WATER MONITORING DATA GOVERNANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This analysis uses public data that describes the lands and waters of the
Pine Ridge Reservation and Oglala Lakota communities. This draft statement
has not been approved by the OST Research Review Board or OLC Institutional
Review Board.

INTERIM REVIEW CONTACT
  Camille Griffith, PhD, Director, OST RRB and OLC IRB
  cgriffith@olc.edu

  Listing the contact does not indicate approval of this analysis.

CARE   : Data use must deliver Collective Benefit to Indigenous peoples,
  respect their Authority to Control, uphold Responsibility to communities,
  and center Ethics across the full data lifecycle.
  Reference: https://www.gida-global.org/care

FAIR   : Data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
  FAIR governs technical standards; CARE addresses responsibilities that
  FAIR alone does not address.
  Reference: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/

IEEE 2890-2025 : Recommended Practice for Provenance of Indigenous Peoples' Data.
  The first international standard for Indigenous data provenance. Establishes
  common parameters for describing and recording how data about Indigenous
  Peoples should be disclosed, connected to people and place, and governed
  across its lifecycle, including AI/ML and biodiversity contexts.
  Reference: https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2890/10318/

CRITICAL DISTINCTION IN THIS SERIES:

  PUBLIC DATA   : federal/public datasets (USGS NWIS, NOAA, Census, NHD)
                  used in analysis notebooks. Freely available but still
                  describing Tribal lands. Results should be shared with
                  OST/OLC reviewers before publication.

  OST DATA      : No OST-collected operational dataset is included in this
                  repository. Such data requires an approved governance,
                  storage, access, and publication process before use.

DEFERRED REVIEW
  Specific OST RRB/OLC IRB wording, preferred terminology, and the local
  applicability of OCAP® remain open review items.

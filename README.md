Overview
Water is the foundation of life and sovereignty for Indigenous communities. This repository provides a modular, reproducible water monitoring system designed specifically for Tribal Nations, built to be deployed locally, adapted to any Nation's data and priorities, and grounded in Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks.

The system has two parallel tracks:

Analysis Track (notebooks) provide reproducible analysis of publicly available water data for education, research, and baseline characterization. Demonstrated at Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations.

Operations Track (pipeline and dashboard) a deployable decision support tool that combines publicly available data with Tribal-collected field observations (well levels, water quality samples) to support day-to-day water management decisions.

Design Principles
Decision support, not research output. The system is built to help someone make a real decision, which well to check first, whether to issue a water advisory, when drought conditions warrant restricting use, not to produce academic findings.

Simple, explainable, auditable. Every indicator can be traced back to a specific value, a specific threshold, and a specific line of code. No black boxes. When someone asks "why is this well flagged critical?", you can point to the exact number and the exact rule.

Offline-first. Public data is cached locally on first download. The pipeline and dashboard run without internet connectivity after that. Designed for Tribal offices with variable bandwidth.

Config-driven thresholds. All alert levels live in config/config.yaml. Sit with Tribal water staff, ask what counts as an emergency for their wells, and change one number so the entire system updates.

Data sovereignty first. Tribal-collected data (well levels, water quality) stays local and is never committed to version control. Public federal data is clearly distinguished from Tribal operational data throughout.

Quick Start
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tribal_water_monitoring
cd tribal_water_monitoring

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tribal-water

# Register the kernel for Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name tribal-water \
    --display-name "Python (tribal-water)"

# Launch the analysis notebooks
jupyter lab notebooks/
First time running the pipeline:

python pipeline/ingest.py      # download public data
python pipeline/groundwater.py # process well data
python pipeline/indicators.py  # compute drought stages
streamlit run app/app.py       # launch dashboard
Data
Public data (downloaded automatically)
All public data is downloaded at first run and cached to data/cache/. No data is committed to this repository.

Source	What	Used in
USGS NWIS	Groundwater levels, streamflow, water quality	Notebooks 02–05, Pipeline
Census TIGER AIANNH	Tribal boundaries	All notebooks
USGS NHD	Stream network, watershed boundaries	Notebook 01, 03
NOAA PDSI	Drought index	Notebook 05
MACAv2	Climate projections	Notebook 07
Tribal operational data (your data)
Tribal-collected data lives in data/raw/ and is never committed. See data/templates/ for blank Excel templates:

groundwater_template.xlsx well level measurements
water_quality_template.xlsx water quality sampling data
See docs/data_intake_guide.md for field staff instructions.

Adapting for Your Nation
This repository was built and demonstrated at Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations. To adapt it for another Tribal Nation:

Update config/config.yaml USGS site IDs, bounding box, thresholds
Update src/constants.py Tribal boundary names, centroid coordinates
Replace data/raw/ files your Nation's well and water quality data
Run the pipeline everything else updates automatically
See docs/adaptation_guide.md for step-by-step instructions.

Data Sovereignty
This repository implements the following data governance frameworks:

OCAP® Ownership, Control, Access, Possession https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/
CARE Principles Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics https://www.gida-global.org/care
FAIR Principles Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/
IEEE 2890-2025 Recommended Practice for Provenance of Indigenous Peoples' Data https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2890/10318/
Tribal-collected data (well levels, water quality samples) is governed by the collecting Nation under OCAP®. Public federal data (USGS, NOAA, Census) is distinguished from Tribal operational data throughout. Analysis results should be shared with the relevant Tribal Nation before publication or external distribution.

See docs/data_sovereignty.md for full discussion.

Oceti Sakowin Context
The analysis notebooks in this repository focus on Pine Ridge (Oglala Lakota) and Rosebud (Sicangu Lakota) as primary demonstration sites, with broader context for all Oceti Sakowin Nations in South Dakota. The Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires) are the collective Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples. The term is used throughout the notebooks because it reflects the Nations' own name for themselves and their relationships to one another.
